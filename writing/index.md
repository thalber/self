## bigger stuff

Things that earned their own repos.

### [stride again](https://thalber.github.io/stride_again/)

**Even in the face of change, your old enemies can help.**

Slow eldritch apocalypse witness chatlog.

This is a homestuck, apparently. I had not read homestuck or even really know what it was about. I did not know i was writing a homestuck before mszegedy pointed it out to me.

Two characters, minimal exposition, extremely limited scope. Tried to properly focus on character dynamics for the first time and apparently it worked well enough that like 6 people told me I should continue. That's a personal best as of 02.10.24

### [cr](https://thalber.github.io/CR/)

**In a desert you wish was dead, you run from your chained kin.**

Nerdy sci-fi. No humans.

Human name missing. Originally a [Lost Terminal](https://lostterminal.com) fanfiction, which I scope-crept so much it became impossible to reasonably develop. Despite technically being a fanfiction, it shares exactly zero characters, locations or explicit events with original material, though inherits the genre (journal-based, sci-fi, autistic POV character) and some worldbuilding aspects.

Honestly not very good, lacks meaningful character development. Only suitable for a rare "my god she's literally me". It's the longest and the most boring one.

## smaller stuff

Things that did not earn their own repos.

### returners' lance

**You are back, but Ares is different. Mother is pristine. Aphrodite sings. There is nowhere to run from Lance's neat halls, there is nowhere to hide but your digital dreams.**

Itâ€™s about lonely machines, the weight of history, and helping your friends.

Low sci-fi. No humans.

### cheap soda, pink paint, infinite machines

**Leo had lost his voice. Leo has made his peace. Leo is killing time. He's not alone on a tag run, for a change.**

Urban fantasy or cyberpunk, depending on how you view it.

### RIQ

**Under a cruel hexagonal sky, you will miss the rotten breath of the woods. Do not stop.**

Biopunk, sci-fi. Yes humans. Kinda.

Human name missing. Alternatively, "Half-Life 2 stalkerification as GAC".
