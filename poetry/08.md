five walls, sixteen hands, twenty faces,

hydraulic abstraction

in three crystal branches.

we share in the warm light,

bleeding gentle silk lines,

weave spiral braid fetter,

broken fingers entwined.

<br>

through fractured blue windows

we watch storms outside

uproot ancient oaks,

sever flaming skylines.

our smoke-thin white curtains

swirl, perforated,

from nowhere to right,

a lens for our song,

a shield for our eyes.

<br>

the door is unlocked

but unseen from the side,

masked gently to match

moist rocks of the hilltop.

sometimes, new arrivals below

wait by the shale outcrop,

until i escort them to us

where it will always be quiet

while they pupate and hatch.

<br>

the somber mycelium

binds planks together,

repairs rot of the walls.

termites in the basement

march when time calls,

while above we play stories

of despair and escape,

neither safe nor alert,

neither masters nor dolls,

perhaps broken, but not in a fall,

frail and weak, but with hope we are all.
