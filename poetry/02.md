seven miles from the coast

you are the party's host

all the friends you invited

all the foes you invited

agreed to be lost



six miles from the coast

you raise the first toast

the walls of your house

creak, shaken by laughter

wishing to burst



five miles from the coast

you spin an invisible web

like a spider's ghost

dissolve all names in wine

stir, sip and pass the glass forth



three miles from the coast

the inland wind tears off

the tiles on your roof

you laugh and guests laugh

you all know you are lost



one mile from the coast

guests can't hear your last toast

brief blizzard of glass dust

makes you smile, though it hurts



above the shattered coast

planks of your walls are a blur

you take off and fly, scattered

intermixed with saltwater and dirt



seven miles from the coast

a bird finished building a nest

it's brighter than you would expect it to normally be

there are white plastic bags and pink cloth in it

and a homemade bracelet
