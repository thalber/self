### [stride again](https://thalber.github.io/stride_again/)

Slow eldritch apocalypse witness chatlog.

This is a homestuck, apparently. I had not read homestuck or even really know what it was about. I did not know i was writing a homestuck before mszegedy pointed it out to me.

Two characters, minimal exposition, extremely limited scope. Tried to properly focus on character dynamics for the first time and apparently it worked well enough that like 6 people told me I should continue. That's a personal best as of 02.10.24

### [cr](https://thalber.github.io/CR/)

Nerdy sci-fi. No humans.

Human name missing. Originally a [Lost Terminal](https://lostterminal.com) fanfiction, which I scope-crept so much it became impossible to reasonably develop. Despite technically being a fanfiction, it shares exactly zero characters, locations or explicit events with original material, though inherits the genre (journal-based, sci-fi, autistic POV character) and some worldbuilding aspects.

Honestly not very good, lacks meaningful character development. Only suitable for a rare "my god she's literally me". It's the longest and the most boring one.
