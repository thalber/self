a seed of hate

a sprout of anger

a tree of ire

follows me



i planted it

in bitter spring

i nurtured it

with yellow bile

i let it pierce

my flaking skin

i led its roots

down past my muscle

down through my lungs

down to my heart



it screams about

the boiling sea

without a sound

without a pause

it calls me to

unwind the rope

to open wounds

to sharpen bones

it pleads me now

it plead me then

it plead me will

i am its host



our joint bramble

suffered fire

our tangled veins

thirsted through drought

its iron bark

shed poison needles

my copper teeth

dug our release



the needle years

would pass, exhausted

the brown sandstone

receded, ground to dust

but iron bark

only grew thicker

and copper teeth

kept biting all i love



on serene fall

i cut its branches

i axed its trunk

shattering ribs

it whined and cursed

i whined and cursed

i lost my nails

stuck in its bark

it lost its thorns

stuck in my neck


it's weaker now

i'm stronger now

the pain is balance

pus is gold

i boil its sap

to burning spirit

it rots my lymph

to blackest dirt



we cut in slow

and keep our promise

i saw its root

it gnaws my spine



the ash grey leaves

wrap on my wrists

and pitch black flowers

trail sickly pollen

on the plastic keys
