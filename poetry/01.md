we painted ourselves on the walls

the empty malls whisper our names

dancing under the burning sky

a bright wave in poisoned air

the leaves have fallen

and will never grow back again

the rivers have dried up

and will never sing again

the orchards are dry and brittle

and will never bear fruit again

the twisting streets are dusty and quiet

and will never flow again

the gods of yesterday stand rusted

and they'll never cut us again

and they'll never connect us again

and they'll never burn us again

and they'll never love us again
