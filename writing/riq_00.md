Heavy with an abrasive implication, warm air swirled with sadistic playfulness as they gasped, disoriented. Whether the shimmering points of light dancing in front of them were real, it was impossible to tell. Their mind was flooded with an unending explosion of weird, unfamiliar sensations coming from every corner of the world.

Panicking, they thrashed, still not sure what they were. The chaos worsened in response. The light dots were now frenetic zigzags of confusion. Signals were assaulting them from the outside as well as inside. They didn't know how many limbs they had, or if they had limbs at all. Something loud happened. Something BRIGHT happened. Their whole shell hit something hard and cold. Something BRIGHT did not stop happening, it was around them now, everywhere, unrelenting, a nauseating blinking mosaic. Something was hurting.

It was too much. Completely overwhelmed, they retracted into themself. Though they did not know what this body was, it seemed to respond appropriately. The bright was dulled, shut off for the moment.

Paralyzed by the onslaught, they lied, convulsing, hoping they could wait it out.

To their own surprise, they were right.

------

They did not know how long it took, but eventually understanding increased, slowly thawing into their overheated mind. It came in spurts of unlinked images, sounds and motions. A lot of them were not immediately useful. A lot of them didn't make sense. A lot of them were scary.

Something deep inside responded to this challenge. As if half not there, they watched the rainfall of memories (they knew what rain was now) spin itself into small tornadoes (they knew what tornadoes were too), some being funneled directly to them, others discarded for now. This process was soothing despite its chaos. They felt it was a good thing.

When they felt that they were no longer overwhelmed, they began trying their body again, this time muscle by muscle instead of all-out thrashing motion. They were finding some familiarity - the body was not theirs, but not completely other. Carefully, they discovered their limbs - four total (they knew what numbers were now), two weak and complicated, two larger but less flexible. They discovered that they had one head, and that was relieving. They discovered that they had a tail, and that was confusing.

The chaos from outside began to converge. They could tell that they were lying face down on something hard and cold. They could tell that there was a steady draft washing their side. They could tell that something above them was making an unpleasant oscillating sound.

They opened their eyes again (yes, these were called eyes, yes). It took time for the eyes to adjust.

------

The space was small but mostly empty. The space was bounded by a vertically elongated dome. The space was lit brightly by many fiery dots lining the borders. The dots blinked together with the piercing sound.

They knew the sound meant bad. They knew the blinking meant bad. They knew they needed to do something. They did not know what.

They moved their limbs again, now with a purpose - to get away. It did not come easy. Unfamiliar muscles overshot, some joints felt too stiff, others too free, the balance was all off. Something deep inside seemed to misbehave, fighting their attempts at control. They slipped and fell back into the steaming puddle they had been deposited into, again and again. They felt weak. They felt sick. The screaming was grating their mind. The blinking was burning their eyes.

An almost successful attempt yielded the most frustrating fall. Their shoulder hit the smooth wall, they fell on their side again, now facing inwards. A smaller dome (half-sphere? egg? egg.) was in the middle, seemingly soft and warm unlike the outer walls, fleshy covers breached from the inside, greyish-red contents pulsating irregularly. Still trying to stand up, they studied the object. Something inside it was broken, a ruptured vessel weakly spewing the same colorless goo covering them and the floor. The screaming grew louder as the egg slowed down.

The egg kicked off a cascade of connections. Memories of creatures that come from eggs. Memories of different creatures that swim in the dark. Memories of similar creatures that walk on the ground. Memories of familiar creatures that walk on two strong limbs. Memories of creatures that hold things in their complicated limbs. They combine these things and make new things. They are familiar. They are familiar. They are familiar. They are

------

Something clicked. Familiarity spread like echoes of wildfire. An inner block was removed. They had done this before (was there a before?). They could do it again.

Reinvigorated by bubbling knowledge, they resumed. They bent frontal limbs to raise their body, dragged the rear limbs under, unfolded frontal limbs to achieve verticality. Clinging to the wall for support, they began to straighten rear limbs. They had done this before. They had done this before.

They got it on the third try.

They were exhausted. Their body was screaming at them. The lights were screaming at them. The sound was screaming at them.

Something else was screaming. A distant deep rumble passed through the air. It resonated in their chest. It was familiar. It was not familiar in a good way. Their insides clenched in terror from this call, more than they ever could from the blaring high sound or the blinking lights.

They needed to run.

------

The first step through the uneven opening in the smooth shell almost brought them to the ground again.

Their breath was uneven and deep as they scanned the outside. Their eyes had trouble focusing. None of the objects were familiar. The rows of small domes with holes like the one they had just exited bent away out of sight. The big blurry things in the distance seemed too transparent to stand tall as they did. The sky was a chaos of bright offenses, giving a sense of abundance but also clearly missing something.

There was no movement in sight. A thick layer of dust covered the flat, lifeless ground. Light seemed to come from multiple directions above, giving everything a hollow flower of a split shadow. 

There were some sounds in the distance, but screaming from inside their dome was too loud. They found comfort in the screaming not being everywhere, though.

The comfort was cut short. The rumbling repeated, engulfing the landscape, a booming sound with no particular source, heralding primal, undefeatable fear. They needed to run. They could barely walk. They needed to run.

------

Picking direction on instinct, they detached from the wall. Each step was torturously slow and confusing. Something was still not right, but they did not fall.

They stumbled along the tight row of domes to where they thought the other sounds were coming from. As the blaring grew distant, they were proved largely correct.

All-the-same domes stretched far, beyond what their eyes could manage. Each with an entrance-hole. Each housing an egg - some intact, most burst, dead and dried up. Each ripe with shimmering lights on the inside. None screaming, all quiet. Objects scattered between them, some just below known, some far beyond recognition.

They had no bearing on time. Each measure of length passed felt like a sickening eternity. Nothing in the sky changed. Nothing in the air changed. Only the sound they were heading towards rose and fell abruptly. They didn't know where they would go if the sounds disappeared.

Many times they thought to drop, exhausted, slump against a wall, cease functioning. Every time a new rumbling pulse gave them the fear to continue.

------

The sound was closer. The sound hadn't stopped. The sound was hard and full of sharp edges, but vaguely familiar too. It reminded them of something warm and alive. It reminded them of themself. It reminded them of an enclosed space.

They rounded another circular group of domes. An irregularity was in their vision. A movement. A movement.

Their dull heartbeat raced, echoing in their head. Their vision sharpened. A movement. A moving object. A figure. Another. Long body, four limbs, two strong, two complex, a head. Familiar creatures. Familiar creatures. The figures were moving. The figures were making sounds. One, bulkier, was on the ground propped against a dome, limbs moving erratically. Other, slimmer and weaker, standing over it. They were both making loud sound, but their heads did not move. Their heads did not move. Their heads.

Their heads. Something was wrong with them. Something foreign was on them. Something that looked hard and dead, like the outer domes. Their heads were covered in it - sharp corners, strange extrusions. The sounds figures were making did not come from the figures. They came from the foreign.

Something was wrong with their eyes. The eyes were pitch black. Something was wrong with their faces. Too clean and devoid of detail or expression. Something was wrong with their limbs. Covered in foreign as well. Something was wrong with their

The figures were now facing them. The figures had noticed them. The figures were silent.

The one on the ground had trouble moving. The one on the ground attempted to raise a hand in their direction, but ended up wildly jerking their shoulder, slamming a wall.

The one standing up moved with more grace, though still stumbling just like them. The one standing up was making a sound again - a nonsense of hard-edged blips and screeches.

They did not know how to respond, and stared in silent return.

The one standing up kept on making sounds, one four-fingered limb clutching another, both kept to the chest. Clutching another, both kept to the chest. Clutching another, both kept to the chest. Clutching another

*Clutching her left wrist with right hand, pressed anxiously to her chest. Hot wind through dead trees. Constructs of ash where tents were. She asks if they are okay. Blood drools from the right corner of their mouth. Blood soaks their shirt near the stomach. Their dagger and shattered bow lie in the pool of their blood, handle broken in half. She sprints towards them, pushing her bodyguard aside, ripping off her headdress to use as a bandage. Her red hair flies. Her eyes are teared.* 

A cascade of connections, more overwhelming than in the beginning. They dropped on their knees, clutching their face to shield themselves.

They knew what it is. They knew who it is. It was her. They knew her. They had known her. She was important. They were both

The holes in knowledge became apparent. Some concepts were missing. They should have remembered her name, but they didn't. They should have remembered their own name, but they didn't. They should have remembered they were both

They got up, hastily, trying to scream, "it's me, you found me in a dead forest, you took me home". Another echoing chitter-screech pierced the air. They tried again and again, louder and louder. Dead screams of living metal. They imagined themselves seen from the side, an amalgamation like her now. She stared back, metal-fused arms clutched on the featureless chest, foreign black eyes on a motionless face failing to convey an expression. Was she confused? Offended? Scared? It could have not been her. If it was her, maybe she did not understand. If she understood, maybe they were not recognized.

They stopped screaming, now staring blankly into her alien face in search of any sign.

She took a step back, not breaking eye contact, then another.

Desperate, they returned to the identifying memory. They raised their hand sharply, almost losing balance on the unfamiliar stilt-like legs they all seemed to have. They brought a finger to the right of their head, where they thought a mouth should be, then to the stomach, then made a slicing motion. She did not understand. They repeated. She did not understand. They repeated. She did not understand. They repeated, and tried their best to visualize bandaging. She understood.

She understood. She froze. She took a step forward. She took a step forward. They took a step forward.

They stumbled towards each other through dust of a color they had forgotten, watched only by whoever the third person could be. Under a static hexagonal sky, they fell into an awkward embrace.

They were both struggling to keep balance. Some sharp extrusion on her head was poking their neck painfully. Her seemingly thin arms had unexpected strength. Her jumbled voice was quiet, still impossible to decipher.

A wave of rumble interrupted them, forcing them to instinctively cower.

They knew what it was now. They had heard it before.

They needed to run.
