future is for those who take it

red from lacerated ovens

of decomposing now

<br>

future is for those who cut it

free from paper shackles

let empty words fall

<br>

future is for those who melt it

with the heat of their tears

forge it into swords

<br>

future is for those who spread it

even as hollow-point rounds

bloom in their chests

<br>

future is for those who saw it

in broken promises of peace

and have nothing left to lose
