a seed of hate

a sprout of anger

a tree of ire

follows me

<br>

i planted it

in bitter spring

i nurtured it

with yellow bile

i let it pierce

my flaking skin

i led its roots

down past my muscle

down through my lungs

down to my heart

<br>

it screams about

the boiling sea

without a sound

without a pause

it calls me to

unwind the rope

to open wounds

to sharpen bones

it pleads me now

it plead me then

it plead me will

i am its host

<br>

our joint bramble

suffered fire

our tangled veins

thirsted through drought

its iron bark

shed poison needles

my copper teeth

dug our release

<br>

the needle years

would pass, exhausted

the brown sandstone

receded, ground to dust

but iron bark

only grew thicker

and copper teeth

kept biting all i love

<br>

on serene fall

i cut its branches

i axed its trunk

shattering ribs

it whined and cursed

i whined and cursed

i lost my nails

stuck in its bark

it lost its thorns

stuck in my neck

<br>

it's weaker now

i'm stronger now

the pain is balance

pus is gold

i boil its sap

to burning spirit

it rots my lymph

to blackest dirt

<br>

we cut in slow

and keep our promise

i saw its root

it gnaws my spine

<br>

the ash grey leaves

wrap on my wrists

and pitch black flowers

trail sickly pollen

on the plastic keys
