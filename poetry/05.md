i caught a glimpse of them again

behind dull glass of office spaces

perched anxiously bird-like on a chair

dry hair suspended in the stale air

for those behind me, it would seem

as if they weren't there

<br>

i didn't freeze or lose my face

our eyes crossed only for a second

they tracked me with a lifeless laze

as i slid past, off from the shopfronts

and went about my day unfazed

<br>

i'm very good at it by now

it's almost never a surprise

their ruined clothes and pit-like eyes

are but a sign that i'm alive

on good days, i can almost smile

<br>

their empty longing followed me

through loops of heat and mud and snow

through lectures, train rides, woodland walks

through hungry rain and giggling crows

their silent ask remains the same

<br>

i cannot satisfy it nor decline it

they cannot be abolished or brought back

their withering and shaking childlike hands

will never reach me through the glass again

they yearn for what i took and they abandoned

<br>

their pale face has been unchanged for years

while mine is drifting off as is expected

and if i smile more and make my hair

sometimes they seem so distant

sometimes they almost aren't me
