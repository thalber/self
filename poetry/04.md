there is an ancient castle

up in the nameless hills

a few large stones stand, crumbling

composing half a wall



we went there in the morning

before the sky would flood

we climbed the winding pathway

left hairs on spiky bush



the vines acknowledged presence

and swirled with sleepy grace

and mounds of moss would whisper

your long abandoned name



we sat to watch the sunrise

hatch from the mountains' crust

the liquid fire oozing

through branches tangled above



no word was ever traded

no gaze was ever met

no bird disturbed your singing

no spider climbed my arms



the heaven's magma poured

into our open eyes

it filled every crevice

with burning orange peace



i wouldn't dare look leftward

though i already knew

you'd made your choice that midnight

there was no steering you



i knew the pale blue gas flame

erupting from your mouth

i knew the playful dust

swirling under your claws

i knew the quiet sizzling

of your four loving eyes

i knew the slowing heartbeat

convulsion of the lungs



there is an ancient castle

up in the nameless hills

a few large stones stand, crumbling

composing half a wall



in my descent through bushes

my eyes were still a flood

with every blind step taken

your pure and glistening ash

took off in motes

danced on the wind
