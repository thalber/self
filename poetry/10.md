with sequences of knives

we trace our jagged lines

with thirst of everdying

we cut through screaming dust

steel tendons snap and send

waves of ecstatic violence

rippling across the deep

popping your eardrums

<br>

our hand expresses lust

of all who couldn't reach you

our fangs drip sulfur smoke

burning your compound eyes

time is a rubber strip

torn and re-welded over

bones that were pulled out

first hour of tonight

<br>

we hope you don't expire

we crave your gurgling song

our tongue joyfully reaching

into your open wounds

our sisters threw themselves

into your pristine pits

their razor-torn lifelines

are here tonight with me
