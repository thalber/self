seven miles from the coast

you are the party's host

all the friends you invited

all the foes you invited

agreed to be lost

<br>

six miles from the coast

you raise the first toast

the walls of your house

creak, shaken by laughter

wishing to burst

<br>

five miles from the coast

you spin an invisible web

like a spider's ghost

dissolve all names in wine

stir, sip and pass the glass forth

<br>

three miles from the coast

the inland wind tears off

the tiles on your roof

you laugh and guests laugh

you all know you are lost

<br>

one mile from the coast

guests can't hear your last toast

brief blizzard of glass dust

makes you smile, though it hurts

<br>

above the shattered coast

planks of your walls are a blur

you take off and fly, scattered

intermixed with saltwater and dirt

<br>

seven miles from the coast

a bird finished building a nest

it's brighter than you would expect it to normally be

there are white plastic bags and pink cloth in it

and a homemade bracelet
